# Conway's Game Of Life
For me, Conway's Game Of Life scratches the itch of fun and challenging (but not too challenging) while also being a great way to learn a new language. This repository contains some of my own implementations of classic problem.

Each implementation has it's own README with more detail for the specific language.

For more information on what the Game Of Life is see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
